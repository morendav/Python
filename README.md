#01 numberGuesser.py
>    script that generates a random number, begins with an initial guess, and iterates until the correct number is guessed by the program.
>    optimizations: version 2 will use the degree of magnitude of the guess-number difference to adjust itself per iteration && removed redundant if conditions to improve run time
>    Module Dependencies: random, math
#02 numberGuesser.py
>    Script that lets you play hangman! woot. Play against the program that will pick a random word from a given list, you have only n chances!
>    Module Dependencies: os, random, setup, file(./Library/RandWordList.txt)
